## COVID-19 Safety Web Application for CU Boulder Students, Faculty/Staff, and Visitors 
Our web application aims to help students, faculty/staff, and visitors move around campus in a safe and efficient manner. 

### Interactive Map 
The COVID-19 Safety App provides users with an interactive map of the CU Boulder campus where they can view information about buildings, parking lots, COVID-19 testing centers and various other locations. Users are provided with information regarding building hours, doors with BuffOne card swipe access, as well as the safety of a location based on the population per square area and number 
of users currently present. Users can also choose to be directed to their destination where the app chooses the safest and fastest 
route in order to direct the user best. Users who create a profile will be able to enter their schedules, including the start time of class or work, the building it is in, and even estimations of how long it will take to get to their favorite parking lot. 

### COVID-19 Information 
Aside from the many features of the interactive map, users have access to the most recent COVID-19 updates for the CU Boulder campus, Colorado State, and the United States. Users can easily view the number of COVID-19 cases on the CU campus and in Colorado as well as the Chancellor's latest messages to our Forever Buff community. 

### Daily Health Questionnaire 
Students and Faculty/Staff will also find that the app has a dedicated page to the Daily Health Questionnaires. The web application will remind users to fill out their Daily Health Questionnaire at a time of the users choosing every day (users can also elect to turn any and all notifications off). Until the Daily Health Questionnaire's are filled out, the completed checkbox will not be marked and the application will continue to send the user reminders (as the user chooses).
